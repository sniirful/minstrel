## Creating the bot
The first step is to actually create the Discord application (as they call it) for the bot. Head over to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click on "New Application".

Give a name to your application (can also be the same as the bot's name) and click on "Create".

## Configuring the bot
Once you have created the bot, you can access it at the same [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) as before.

When you click on it, you can start customizing the app information, starting with the description.
![[create-discord-bot-4.png]]When you're done editing the bot's About Me section, just click on "Save Changes" (and if you want to go back, click "Reset").

Further customization can be found by clicking the "Bot" section at the left of the page.

Here, you can finally change the bot's profile picture and its username.
Another important option is "Public Bot", which we strongly recommend to turn off.

Again, when you're done, just click on "Save Changes".

## Adding the bot to your server
Again, go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click on the bot. Then, click on "OAuth2" and "URL Generator".

In the "Scopes" section, only tick the "bot" box.
![[create-discord-bot-11.png]]A new section will appear, namely "Bot permissions", which you don't really need since that will only create a custom bot role that you cannot delete. You can manage the bot's roles and permissions yourself later when it's already joined. Leave that section blank.

At the bottom you'll see the last section, "Generated URL". Click on "Copy", paste the link in a new browser tab and follow the Discord procedure to add the bot to your server.

## Moving on
Now that the bot has joined your server, you can move on to [configure Minstrel](TODO).
